# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have **Heart Disease** using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classification algorithm. The model is trained on the Heart Disease dataset using various medical parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, heart rate, and more.

A simple and interactive **Streamlit GUI** is developed for real-time prediction.
