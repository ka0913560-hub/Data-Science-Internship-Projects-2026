# 🌳 Heart Disease Prediction using Random Forest Classifier

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts whether a patient is likely to have **Heart Disease** using the **Random Forest Classifier** algorithm. The model is trained on the Heart Disease dataset using various medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, chest pain type, maximum heart rate, and more.

A user-friendly **Streamlit GUI** is developed to allow users to enter patient details and instantly predict the presence of heart disease.
